# 🧠 OOP Assignment – Python

## 📁 Overview

This repository contains solutions to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** assignment. It demonstrates key OOP principles such as **classes**, **constructors**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism** through two fun and creative activities.

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class – **Superhero Example**

### ✨ Description

In this part, I created a class representing a **Superhero**. The goal was to bring the class to life by:

- Defining attributes such as `name`, `power`, and `universe`
- Using the `__init__` constructor to initialize each superhero with unique data
- Creating **subclasses** like `FlyingHero` and `Speedster` to explore **inheritance**
- Demonstrating **encapsulation** by using private attributes
- Overriding methods to showcase **polymorphism**

### 📂 File: `superhero.py`

### 🔍 Key OOP Concepts Covered:
- Class creation
- Object instantiation
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge – **Vehicles Example**

### ✨ Description

This part demonstrates **polymorphism** using a base `Vehicle` class and three subclasses:

- `Car` – prints "Driving 🚗"
- `Plane` – prints "Flying ✈️"
- `Boat` – prints "Sailing 🚢"

Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to provide its own implementation. A single function `start_journey()` is used to demonstrate polymorphism in action.

### 📂 File: `vehicles.py`

### 🔍 Key OOP Concepts Covered:
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism with a shared interface
- Reusability and clean structure

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Then in your terminal or code editor, run:

```bash
python superhero.py
python vehicles.py
